# Introduction

It's awesome that you are interested in contributing to Pullp! :raised_hands:

To try and make the process as smooth as possible this document contains some guidelines to help you get started.

### What contributions can I make?

Contributions small and large are welcome. Pullp was developed fairly sporadically when I had free time, and there are many areas that could benefit from refactoring, test coverage and improved documentation. If you're wondering where to start, try checking the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rkclark/pullp/issues) for issues marked as `help wanted`!

If you're considering contributing a new feature, check whether it has already been raised on the issue tracker as an `enhancement`. If not, please add it and we can discuss whether it would be appropriate to add to the app.

# :exclamation: Ground Rules

Please make sure you:

- Are considerate and respectful to other contributors.
- Cover your code with tests.
- Ensure that the linter and tests are passing before submitting. (Husky will run these automatically when you commit)
- Write clear commit messages in the style described in [this brilliant blog post by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), like these:
    > `Add login action and reducer`
    >
    > `Refactor Button component`
    >
    > `Fix padding on open repo frame`


# :star2: How to make a contribution


1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Open a pull request

Your changes will be reviewed and you may be asked to make amendments.

When your changes are accepted they will be rolled into a release as soon as possible!


# :bug: How to report a bug


When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Pullp are you using?
2. What operating system are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

If it is a visual issue, please provide screenshots.

It is also useful to know whether there are any console errors. You can open the dev tools using the usual shortcuts to access the console.
